(Also make sure that you have the FTDI driver installed)

**Important:** _If you have video and digital side of the osd separated you also have to power the video side to be able to upload the new character file!_

**Impoertant:** _If you are using plane FW you have to upload the character uploading FW (The firmware file is located at Config_Tool_directory\FW & Char\Character_Updater_FW.hex) to be able to upload character file. (The latest plane fw does not suports this function.) After characres are uploaded you can upload the Plane FW again._
