# Warnings

Warning messages are blinking signs to let you know there is something wrong, or dangerous is happening.

To help you more, in an emergency situation warnings will bring you back to your home screen automatically, so you can focus on flying.

Warnings can be turned on to a specific screen. (Screen 1 os screen 2)
This safety screen switching method can also be turned of. (Warnings are still displayed on the configured screen but no autoswitch is aplyed.)
