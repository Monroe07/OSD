# Video Standards

Setting video standards is done trough CT.

It can be set in the "Video Mode" menu.

It is very different from the original method, since it will always boot in the mode you select. This will be default. Except if there is a different standard is connected than it was configured! This MinimOSD will detect and will change the standard to the correct one automatically. (Only once during boot time. If MinimOSD already booted than the overlay will disappear.)

After changing this option don't forget to do a "Save current tab to OSD" in the configuration panel, so MinimOSD EEPROM is updated.
